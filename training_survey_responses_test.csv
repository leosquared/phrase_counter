"Time commitment. Sometimes it's hard to budget time for this work when I have three young children to myself while my husband travels. Alternately, just being able to attend events when my husband is gone is difficult sometimes. I think growing the chapter and getting more people engaged in our work will be key to helping thin the workload/commitment expected of our snowflake leaders."
My biggest challenge is time -- that's something I have to work out on my own.
"Biggest challenges: TIME and money. I can't drop everything else going on in my life to organize an event for Moms with just 1-2 weeks notice. I need more lead time from National to be able to schedule events or projects, so I can plan and purchase the items I need -- which are often not available locally, so I have to buy them online, which requires time to locate, order and receive them. It would also be helpful for National to provide suggestions for vendors or websites to purchase things like bells for the ""No More Silence"" events (Dec. 2013), or craft items for various projects. Not everything's available on Amazon.com. I don't have a lot of time to be searching for things in person or online."
"Accessing the Hub, Van Lack of support in our state Population spread over large geographic area"
Diversifying our audience
Need large numbers of people to communicate to legislators about MDA initiatives and desired outcomes
"As a mom with many other volunteer commitments, it's hard to find the time to do it all."
Nothing works unless we build and maintain our local grassroots network.
managing time with other work and home commitments.
Staying on top of the information flow. Rearranging my own priorities and suggesting - kindly - that presenters be well organized and less wordy.
spending a short time each day on Moms activities to try and stay on top of the volume of information that is received
Lack of information and involvement in planning and decision making. Stop making all decisions at the national level. Make room at the policy planning table for local volunteers who actually know the leaders and politicians in their area.
Time. I wish I had more time to devote. I hope training can accomodate my schedule better and be concise.
"Messaging to elected officials. Need to be patient, logical and persistent."
"Allowing time, giving deadlines, positive encouragement and feedback, sharing of skills, having fun while working hard"
Reaching the hinterlands. Growing our Chapter statewide.
"Not enough people in the group, which means there's only a few of us doing all the work."
Local communication. Training locally
"making school safety/ gun violence prevention a reality in low-income/minority areas like East San Jose Ca (ie the NOT "" Silicon Valley"" parts of this metropolitan area"
comfort in speaking publicly/with elected officials. I need practice and would welcome coaching
Learning more about the organization and how to address certain topics/questions from the public or potential new volunteers
Being organized and getting new volunteers enthused about participating
"Time management: being able to prioritize effectively for the most gain. Example: Was VERY behind in Moms communications while working on state elections, and working with Everytown on ballot initiative signature gathering. Add in family and work. . ."
Pre-arrange/schedule time to assist and be consistent
I need to get up to speed technologically.
"not getting information and consistent support from National, in a timely fashion that makes volunteers feel appreciated and supported."
Time! Hard to run my own business and make enough time to volunteer. Not sure how to address it!
"We will try to secure speaking engagements in 2015. Past response and participation has been low, so it's easy to become discouraged."
when i was first asked to speak in front of a group regarding Moms. i addressed this challenge by being as informed as i possibly could. i asked several members of Moms who had spoken in front of audiences before to 'coach' me. this was extraordinarily helpful.
Unfortunately there just aren't enough hours in the day.
"Time - I work full time, and I am a single mom of 4. It's tough. I would like to do more, but time is is my biggest challenge."
When recruiting new members in my community parents don't feel their child's life matter. We need to address this issue because all lives matter .
Need to find a buddy in my area Need to go through VAN
"Time management and doing important things before urgent things. If somebody takes over my Ambassador role, I will probably be less scattered. Also, if I stopped looking at Facebook. :)"
"Need more people to work with me - more volunteers. I need to develop a strategy, target people and rope them in. Would be good to have others to bounce ideas off of on this as well."
Feel outside the information loop. I would like to be included in campaign rollouts in order to disseminate goals effectively and timely.
Convoluted and unworkable approval process for communications materials.
"My biggest challenge challenge currently is being responsive to last minute campaigns. Careful timeline management for campaigns is critical. We need an outline for a new campaign 30 days in advance, with all materials prior to the one week mark, in order to be responsive to the needs of our members, hosts and leaders."
"feeling confident, mainly because I am new to all of this but have a great group of ladies for support"
"Understanding specific objectives required to reach goals. - In my experience as a volunteer and managing volunteers, I feel that you have to be very specific about what you're trying to accomplish and how you plan to accomplish it. I feel that this true of national goals- we want to pass universal background checks, how are we going to do it? At state levels - we need to grow our membership numbers and lobby against gun bills in our state - how are we going to do it? Also - making outreach programs more ""turn key"" through the use of toolkits - which should include videos, power points/prezis, and handouts. e.g. CAP presentations, house parties, safety fairs, church groups/youth group presentations, school board presentations, etc. Having to create these yourself each time is time consuming and is often times the reason someone decides against presenting somewhere or having house party."
"Time - how to most effectively use my limited time. Preplanned, packaged activities are great. And having more information at my disposal to feel the time I put in is used to the fullest."
Time management. I need to organize my week better. Set aside specific days and hours when I will do the membership work. I have built up the membership team to help make calls finally. Was on the verge of burn-out. And must limit my time on social media.
Setting aside more time to dedicate to the movement.
"I need to hear from someone with expertise about specific ways in our context, to get our message out to the public."
"Biggest challenge is occasional discouragement. I address this by noting how far things have come in the relatively brief life of this fine organization,"
My own personal challenge in being a volunteer with MOMS is lack of experience. I feel as tho I will overcome this with time and taking advantage of the training MOMS will offer.
I don't have any issues in my research role.
Mentoring by leadership
Sometimes I feel like I am being pulled in too many different directions.
"I do not have a professional background in Communications, so I would benefit from training on strategies on how to build an effective Communications Plan for my Chapter"
"Just staying up on the quickly changing priorities and events- its hard to keep track of it all. Not sure exactly how to address it, other than keep developing our organizational and communication skills as a chapter."
"My time is very limited as a I work full time. I often have ""wife/mommy guilt"" when I choose to spend my time doing Moms work. One way to alleviate is to include my husband in kids, though not all activities are appropriate for them."
"My biggest challenge is trying to make time to complete tasks because I have a job and 3 kids! I save most of my Mom's work for evenings and weekends, unless there is an urgent need for action."
"I am a shy extrovert (seeming contradiction). Though I have preached in my church about gun violence, spoken at a hearing, on the phone and one on one, I always need to mentally gear up. Basically I have to tell myself to power through my reticence, read the materials carefully and just (as the Nike people say) do it."
Time management. I wish I had the organizational skills necessary to judge my paid and unpaid work along with family obligations and staying sane. I have been trying to institute specific blocks of time every week to Moms activities with limited success.
Use resources from Moms to help gain confidence in understanding &amp; articulating our issues.
The biggest challenge is time management while juggling work and family along with volunteer duties. Finding some people to help me in planning and organizing the events would be helpful.
Having time to do what needs to be done. Make sure you have other volunteers to share the work load.
"The organization and GVP is constantly in flux. This is a good thing, because it means our grass roots movement is growing at a rapid rate, but sometimes it makes it difficult to keep up with chapter growth and leadership development. We are always playing catch up. As the leadership grows and trainings grow, I will be more able to be proactive and create a real sustainable chapter and movement within my state."
Time. Need more chapter volunteers trained in VAN to keep up with data entry/management.
How to effectively recruit volunteers who follow through and stay engaged. Hearing from chapters who have been particularly successful at this would be helpful.
"Getting other people to get involved and participate actively. I really don't know how to do this, and find it frustrating."
Knowledge about the political process
"I've been pretty active in Moms for about 15 months (and for longer as a new ""accidental activist"" after Newtown). I feel like I don't need training, as much as support. By now we have a fairly good read of our state, but could use support in implementing ideas/ messaging. Having access to memes, policy papers, tight goals, etc."
Time availability
My biggest challenge as Chapter Leader is keeping up with all the email &amp; projects! I am going to make the time. Make it happen.
Issue burnout. Attendance to gatherings. Regular updates re: info and successes.
Need more information. I would like to understand my position better.
Motivation
I AM SHY AND NOT VERY ORGANIZED. I WORK ON MY SHYNESS DAILY
I would like to speak with other CL's about how they address the challenges that concern me.
National needs to do better job of empowering local chapters
Clear understanding of mission and purpose of MDA
I have volunteered in grassroots campaigns/political campaigns but I was not the one organizing it!
"I very much want to be a voice and on the front lines. To be effective, I would like to be ""trained"" by your staff, or through other resources. Once I am comfortable and confident that I can convey the message, I will be nonstoppable."
"I think we are addressing our issues in Indiana. We (Stephanie Grabow &amp; I) saw last summer that as the numbers were mushrooming we needed to keep organizing and reaching out to new IWTH responses. We started on the Snowflake 2.0 model before Denver, I went to being the Comm Lead from CL because we were unable to adequately fill that role. My Comm Lead goal is to develop an IN network of media contacts and Moms volunteers in towns throughout the state, in order to localize our news releases and media initiatives. We are developing a team of people who can assist with building that structure and will be available for LTEs, op-eds, etc."
"I feel like I lack the time that is needed to devote to the role of Chapter Leader. I don't really know how to address this issue, but I would like to have more people to draw on."
More conversations with our chapter lead that help me understand better what events can do to help us reach that goal
"I find it challenging to maintain my level of enthusiasm about Moms (although I will always remain passionate about this issue), because I feel constrained in how I can reach out to and support communities most affected by gun violence. I also feel that Moms is now a national-level, mainly social media organization. I joined Moms when grassroots-level, ""do what you can"" was the prevailing energy...how it's ""don't do that until you bring it before 2 levels of people and then we might pass it on to national for approval"""
I work full time. I need to be able to focus on growing the chapter for a dedicated block of time every week.
I don't know
The time commitment. I feel like it is hard to put Moms down and not address everything that comes my way. It has also been frustrating to deal with the lack of time the NY staff has had to deal with our needs. We have ended up having to wait for months for them to tell us what we can and can't do. I feel like they don't trust us to be able to do our jobs.
Keeping volunteers interested and motivated More projects
Time- I am actually stepping down from the Comms role as soon as a replacement can be found b/c the time commitment and scope of role is not what I expected.
I'd like to train and activate members quickly. Easier access maybe? I often spend too much time searching out how to get specific information to members.
Time.
"Time, as I work full-time. I will set aside 30"" to 1 hour everyday for MOMS activities."
Mobilizing volunteers and effective timely communication. Utilizing VAN will help. Sometimes messages regarding campaigns get to us late or lag time with public facilities makes planning difficult. I am very isolated geographically from the rest of my team.
I need HELP in Arkansas to build this chapter. Building the chapter is a full time job. I need assistance to bring a leadership team together and deligate tasks.
My biggest challenge is how to get others to take on specific parts of the comms work and stay committed. I think I could address it by individually calling folks instead of sending a group email and hoping for a volunteer.
Being assertive with people I don't know
My children - getting them involved volunteering.
Recruiting strong volunteers that can jump in and be active. Need to focus on the go getters and keep them involved. Local trainings by our leadership team is the most effective to reach out to new leaders - which means travel for one-to-one meetings/events.
"I need very concrete tasks and deadlines to make it work for me. Right now, I'm focusing on completing the call list which is measurable and has a finite end. I would like other such tasks when I complete that one."
"Personal outreach to new volunteers, making the ask to join as an active volunteer. Would like more training on growing the grassroots org!"
I am open to any and all training. The biggest challenge seems to be getting organized and somehow ahead of the curve. There is so much information that I have a very difficult time sorting it and then accessing it and thus waste too much time. Have had a difficult time filling the snowflake and this seems again due to organization. Kind of a circular problem. Not enough active volunteers so too much work falls to me so...not enough time to recruit ... and around and around. Trying to work smarter not harder and have no additional time to commit.
Unable to get consistent participation on our chapter conference calls. Emails seem best at this point.
It is often difficult to plan and execute an event within the timeframe allotted by National. Plan: coalition build; organize our membership into meaningful and accessible groups; identify and involve Moms who have indicated an interest in being actively involved.
"Our RM. Additionally the temporary lack of a Chapter Leader. To Address the problem ? Different RM who realizes most of her volunteers are 1) better educated, 2) more experienced and 3) at least as busy as she is."
More in-person and written training about organizing events.
"I work full-time and am coming to feel that this is really incompatible with an active volunteer role with Moms. Am not sure how to address this. Don't think it's a training issue, though."
Continuous communication between myself and peers that have overcome such challenges
time
Building a strong base of volunteers in my area.
"Time management. I would like to delegate more, freeing up more time to be helpful in the way I can service best"
Understanding my exact role and duties.
"Teaming effectively across the state--need tips on communicating via email, FB, phone with new volunteers in far-flung places"
time constraints and lack of background in communications
"I fear being challenged by the Open and Carry crowd, especially if they're really combative. I don't like conflict. I think role playing would help a lot. I think if I'm actually successful in that sitiuation, it would help me as well."
I need to do more homework
The opposition
"Honestly, it's time. I have three young children, my husband travels, I work part time and volunteer in school, etc. The only way I see that fixed is having childcare stipends so I can focus on Moms occasionally."
Having enough time to devote to spreading the work to new volunteers
My biggest challenge is organizing my SF. We are currently struggling with communication and involvement. I have asked for ideas from the more active SF leads and my RM. Will implement soon.
"I don't have enough time to do all the work but I'm working on training phone bankers who can help a lot. It's also a struggle finding people to consistently come to all the events I want to do. We need to plan earlier, advertise better, and follow-up with all RSVP's."
Time and understanding how to lobby. Experience in lobbying would help.
Biggest challenge is not having other Lead positions filled. Trying to address it by planning events to engage with new members who hopefully want to step up.
"Time. I need more time. If I could have 24 more hours in the day, that other people don't have, that'd be pretty cool."
"We have had a hard time getting volunteers for our chapter, especially in leadership roles"
"Volume! We have a huge volume of new members flooding us. The best way for us to address it has been consistent attention. We cannot get to all of the new volunteers in one week, so we consistently phonebank to new volunteers every week, slowly cutting down the backlog of names."
"I am a victim survivor. At times, it feels like a disadvantage because of the perception of my experience. It is no one's fault, it is a natural occurrence when it comes to GVP work."
"Autonomy from the Chapter Head to build a team, plan events and collaborate/execute with all of the leadership team to make them successful. Team members were assigned to me by Chapter Head that are not the best fit for the role. Need time &amp; activities to engage members &amp; active volunteers to build a good team. Also need the support and encouragement from the Chapter Head to take ownership of role to do the things that are working towards the best interest of the issue."
Familiarity with the VA legislative process and how to influence it. More in depth group training.
"My communication skills, location of events"
"Being able to effectively manage my time so that the other areas of my life don't suffer while I'm fixing the nation's gun problem! This ""volunteer"" job is one that I put at least 40 hours a week into. I love the work - but I need to not treat it like a full time job."
Need ideas on how best to delegate and manage personalities
Biggest challenge is getting buy in of minority moms based on current campaigns which are not top of the list items regarding gun violence in minority communities. We have had success with events such as Grilling for Gun Sense and Domestic Violence special event. Support groups for grieving moms that have lost their sons may be good strategy to gradually get them involved. I believe that marketing material is beginning to reflect minorities as well. Continue to promote marketing strategies that reach them and that look like them as well.
The biggest challenge is balancing time with work and family commitments. I often try to incorporate Moms work when I am at family or kid functions. I even did a gun sense seminar at work today!
lack of volunteers
"The biggest challenge will be recruiting and developing volunteers in South Alabama. We are in the early stages of developing our chapter. Key rolls are filled and now we need to bring in people to help with projects and events. Alabama is very pro gun as a state, but there are people who want to help make sensible gun reform happen."
More training
"Personally my biggest challenge is shortage of time to devote to Moms due to life juggling! To address this, I plan to quit my gainfully employed job next month and devote (much) more time to Moms next year."
"I feel the lack of an organizational infrastructure. While individuals are very helpful, there is an assumption that volunteers are able to take on an enormous amount of individual initiative and are able to devote an enormous amount of time to getting up to speed. How to address this? Conference calls - meetings- manuals-more accessible software program-training."
"Once again, my biggest challenge is getting people up and off their butts :-). You SAY you want to be involved. Now how do I get you to BE involved. I am out of ideas for addressing this issue. That is why I am seeking support in this area."
Re being a Data Lead: what (if any) is the role (and activities) for this position?
"My biggest challenge is getting the database down to a manageable size. I'm going to work specifically on the database this month, comparing it with my old spreadsheet to make sure all of my old information is in there."
Things constantly changing and happening at the last minute - national needs to address this.
Biggest challenge is activating more volunteers and getting feedback. I'm addressing it by training small groups at house parties.
"I have no way to gauge my effectiveness as a volunteer, no benchmarks or specific objectives."
I feel that there are holes in my knowledge and training
"I have wonderful contact via email with my regional and State leaders, but distance is a factor. I need volunteers to assume different roles."
Following someone else's approach.
"In South Carolina so few people are willing to be active on gun issues. Most new volunteers I speak with are willing to sign petitions or write to their lawmakers, but very few want to show public support. I feel statewide events at the state capital which helps provide visibility is helpful. ""Build it and they will come."""
communication - CL should be allowed to reach out directly to specific point people at ET
Harnessing the diverse interests and energies of those signing on.
"Having to wait for someone to answer my questions. I feel like the Regional people who are told to go to are grossly overworked and have a hard time really being available. They need some relief so that we on the grounds here are not competing for time with other states events. An example would be getting handouts you need for an event after the event is has already started even thought the request for them was done at least 10 days ahead of the event. I know it is because she had to get permission as well and was swamped with events in other cities. She needs help! PS She's great at her job and works long hours for MOMS. The help I feel she needs is not due to her lack of professionalism or experience. Just to be clear, I am NOT complaining about her ability, more the unrealistic expectations I feel she is working under."
"Getting the contact information/up to date for new members to contact: their accurate phone numbers, email addresses, etc."
I would like to request a way to get our ideas heard and given a thoughtful consideration. More training and team development would be a good way to feel more empowered to take on new goals.
Energy. Messaging. Ability to inspire others and get them engaged.
"Dealing with our RM. While I assume she is dealing with demands from her superiors, I still get very tired being either ignored, or given rude orders. The lack of respect is amazing! How to handle? I think the method of screening RMs or Operating Managers has to REALLY change! How do you teach respect?"
Guidance on what to be doing
Sharing of tactics to reach out and grow the volunteer pool from within a conservative red state.
"training for snowflakes. Ambassadors need training materials not just assignments Training for membership team in using VAN and a place to get answers quickly such as private FB group or in FAQs/Chat. Event leads need clearer instructions in a timely manner. If I can't get answers to their questions and materials are tardy in being sent out, everyone gets frustrated. Send out clear instructions in time to plan events instead of piece meal instructions at the last minute."
I have trouble with conference calls from National. I work through the day and cannot participate in live calls. A recording would be nice. Another issue we have is getting members to become involved past Facebook and social media. I would like to see Kentucky have more events but it is hard to justify the expense if members do not show. We have had success at signing new members this way but not activating.
I'd love more training on outreach and best practices.
"Working with National comms (in particular) has been very difficult since the merge. Turnaround is too slow and we usually do not get what we need, then it is too late or incorrect. They seem overwhelmed and don't seem to have an understanding of what is most effective in our state. I think that if we went back to the older model where more could be done through the regional manager this could be resolved."
"Focus on actual events, especially involving children. Ask more questions."
At the moment my biggest volunteer role is membership lead. I often get requests to run reports of local members and/or volunteer lists for various membership recruitment events and email addresses are not included. I understand the national organization's reasoning behind this however it impedes our efforts at the local level and creates additional work/time commitment for volunteers to have to look these up individually. Solution: create guidelines/levels of access to include email addresses in these lists depending on use.
Get other Moms to buy in to delegating. I found. Many ambassadors wanted to do it all. It has been hard to know just what everyone was doing
"Lack of leader in KC, MO is spread out. Not sure what objectives, strategies and tactics are in our state, much less campaigns/candidates to support. What are we supposed to be doing right now? What's our focus?"
"I'm still looking for ways to be involved. Maybe that is just my ignorance of the organization and strategic planning. (Of course, I started volunteering during the busy last months of the I594 campaign)"
keeping Volunteers informed and charged up to welcome new members
I asked a friend to mentor me in how to manage my time and use it most effectively and efficiently.
Keeping up with EVERYTHING. Looking forward to Advocacy Lead for CAP role--feel it will enable me to become more of a resource in a specific area.
"I want to do more and get more involved, but it seems that most of my confirmed meetings are often cancelled and shifting to future dates."
Keeping all lines of communication open with as many fellow volunteers and paid ET staff as possible.
"As stated above, I do not have sufficient guidance as to what the plan is, if anything, in La."
The biggest challenge I face is not attempting to do everything myself. I need to better define volunteer roles and reach out for assistance.
"It's been hardest to recruit snowflake members and active volunteers. Moms has lost much of its original grassroots feeling, and it's becoming more difficult to keep volunteers feeling engaged and empowered. We need to provide thorough, effective trainings and then trust volunteers to carry out their work without such stringent oversight. I think some of this could be alleviated by moving some areas of oversight down to regional managers and chapter leaders."
Time. We need to recruit more members to act as backups.
"The biggest challenge is the open-ended nature of the ambassador role: no clearly-defined job description, job ""creep"", etc. I have 25 years of project management experience in running architectural projects and I'm very frustrated by this. Ambassadorships are the ""catch-all"" role, with no set parameters, no boundaries. Perfect for burnout and high turnover. A new structure needs to be found to provide support for ambassadors; to provide them other volunteers to whom they can delegate. And no, we don't have the time to train these support positions, on top of everything else we do!"
Time and efficiency; Moms' binder of information all in one place with volunteer job descriptions and expectations.
Getting enough people to help. Generate more interest in my town.
"The environment in which I live, ""old, white conservative, retired,AND rich boating community""NOW THAT DOES NOT SPEAK TO THE WHOLE COUNTY but the county is very spread out and there are conservative very poor white folks too in poor neighborhoods who do not bother to vote or vote conservative. ( read LOTS OF GUNS)"
Managing stress and keeping up statewide morale. I continue to bring our group together as best we can and as often as we can in a large state--will hold a party at my home in 2015 to celebrate and look forward.
"The biggest challenge is garnering likes on our social media page ( our state chapter Facebook page). Perhaps concentrating on local stories pertaining to our state issues would address this and having our volunteers invite their Facebook friends to ""like"" our state page which would then drive traffic to the National page."
Need regular communication with chapter leaders.
It would be valuable for the Chapter to have regularly planned face to face meetings to deepen relationships.
"Getting communications put in a timely manner. When we send newsletters, opt-eds, media statements, press releases...to National it's very hard to publish these quickly for the work we have to do."
My biggest challenge is I hate talking on the phone. I will need to really come up with the nerve to do it
"The biggest challenge I face is confronting deep rooted opposition. I approach the situations with caution. I like to keep the communication open, get a good read on situations and then determine how info will be shared."
my biggest challenge is finding the time to participate in activities
Maintaining the ideal that the GVP movement is most important aspect of all and no matter what happens to remain in the middle and continue the work.
"Finding time, using it effectively. Getting motivated when a particular campaign or initiative seems ""off the critical path"" are all challenges. Perhaps engaging in more interactive policy briefings would address it."
"I AM UNCLEAR ON MY RESPONSIBILITIES AS DATA LEAD. I HAVE CONTACTED ANOTHER CHAPTER'S DATA LEAD FOR ASSISTANCE AS NEEDED, BUT STILL NEED A MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF MY ROLE."
"Biggest challenge I have is not having a clear understanding of the chain of command. Hopefully we can address this with the transition to OM's. Because processes change so rapidly (a natural part of the development of the org), sometimes volunteers are unaware of changes in procedure, sometimes I find that our RM is not clear on procedure. Maybe this info is given to the CL and doesn't filter to the rest of the chapter leadership. Better lines of communication and repeated communication about procedural changes would really help with this."
"Executing events beyond the Boston area. Creating state regional ambassadors who have more connections to venues and people, like our North Shore has done really well. Would like to see a South shore and Worcester/Blackstone Valley become more active."
"Volunteer engagement and growing the chapter. Growing our chapter through holding more events. We are so short handed, and it's always the same group of people showing up to our events. Our event lead is amazing, but she often is backed up against parameters beyond her control (budget issues, meeting space, etc.). We need the tools -- and money -- to grow this chapter, and I think that growth will start with our ability to host amazing membership meetings."
Our chapter needs more members. I think more local events could address that need.
Membership. Updating our van database and calling new members that have not been called.
Not getting I want to help notices from national for prolonged periods. Getting people who say they will volunteer to keep their commitments and getting teaching for our new chapter
We are way too white and way too suburban.
"Need coherence, numbers, and strategy with a very hostile pro-gun climate in our state."
Leadership that can motivate and attract new members.
"We need more regional ambassadors, and they must be required to do three simple things, at a minimum: (1) Call and greet new members in their area; (2) host a meeting once every 8 weeks at least; (3) know how to reach their local people in VAN. This will be the key to everything."
Getting volunteers to commit to leadership roles. I don't know how to address this.
"Not in a position to answer that. We have terrific leadership across the board, so short of moving us to another state I can't offer any suggestions."
We need better outreach to bring in new members
"recruiting additional members, having consistent activity level from month to month - things for our members to do to keep them engaged."
Most of the volunteers here are overqualified for their roles. Delegate more to local chapters. Provide differing levels of support based on what chapters need.
I don't know that I can say what our chapter's biggest challenge is. Maybe just getting people interested?
Building grassroots capacity. Effective use of media and social media.
Finding others to share in the leadership work
Getting people to follow through once they make a commitment. Getting people involved to begin with. We need to do some traveling to get local groups in at least Roswell and Los Alamos and Santa Fe up and going. I have one person in SW NM. No one active in Las Cruces or NW NM
"Biggest challenge I see is that there aren't enough people who know MDA and what we do, especially in governmental positions. I think more political outreach would help. We need to put the name in front of more people."
Getting the word out. Trying to explain our purpose effectively.
materials en espanol; campaigns to support school safety and alternatives to gangs &amp; guns for at risk youth are not yet priorities and in California IMO they should be
i think our chapter if pretty effective overall
"Partnering with other organizations -- in Alabama, we're going to have to make friends with established organizations to have any chance of success. We're not the majority, but I think we can find the right allies, and when we do, I think we can make a difference."
"Steering our chapter to take on the Domestic violence issue in SC, particularly with the high number of handguns involved."
Consistency and follow through.
Visibility---marketing
"Fix the complete cluster F* of internal communications. ~ hopefully, the new Moms dedicated staff will help?"
Spreading beyond the metro areas of Portland / Salem / Corvallis. Attracting members/volunteers in the African American &amp; rural communities.
"The gun culture here is pervasive so it's very difficult to see progress with the current mindset and government officials. Our core group of active members is very small, despite events, networking efforts and much time invested."
"Biggest challenge: lack of communication. And the communication we do rec is often terse, without explination. You can't get everyone on board with 1 sentence, often rude emails. Better people skills are needed by leadership."
getting people together. we are trying (and nina bandi is doing a great job) to schedule gatherings at various locations/times to 'spread the word'. it really helps to produce a lot of energy.
"Our state is so varied in its regional views on gun violence. What may be easy in my region, may be really tough for a volunteer in central or western PA. It's hard to know how I can help those volunteers."
My chapter is very effective to me
we are all physically spread out across state
"We really need to grow our chapter and have more people take on snowflake roles. We have a lot of ""worker bees,"" but we don't have a lot of success in getting people to commit to Big Jobs."
Growing our chapter and getting our snowflake filled is our biggest ongoing issue.
"Break down bottlenecks that exist between national and state leadership. Also, local and state should be given more access to local and state media. We're missing opportunities to grow membership, increase name recognition and keep our issues in the spotlight. We're missing low hanging fruit."
"The Dads chapter is always a challenge, but John does a great job and hopefully, life will calm down enough for me personally to carry a larger burden for him."
"Our biggest challenge is being responsive in a quick timeframe--we have our individual roles, but it is hard to get the first person in the relay activated on schedule, to push through the rest of the race."
still too new to know
"We must build our base of engaged, ""stakeholders."" I see Moms members in three categories - 1) general members (people who sign up and may or may not ever participate in events but who agree with us and will likely vote with us) 2) Active volunteers (people who want to get involved and attend events and who are willing to volunteer their time in small amounts to lobby, host house parties, or phone bank, etc). 3) Stakeholders/leadership (people who look at their role almost as a job, people who do something Moms-related most everyday.) Our chapter needs to do a better job converting members to volunteers and volunteers to stakeholders. I feel that we can increase these conversion rates by engaging volunteers and empowering them with information (keeping them in the loop about Moms nationally and locally), education, and responsibility. We have recently begun doing monthly mixers which I think is key to team building. We are looking to do some lobbying training as well. And, we need to do chapter or at least city-wide chapter meetings monthly or at least every other month- not just leadership meetings. Volunteers need to be trained on effective recruiting techniques. In sales, you follow the ABC - always be closing - model. We need to adopt something similar. If you're talking to someone who's interested in Moms, volunteers should be trained on how to get the person to sign up right then. When we do mixers each month, I give out an overview of each of the snowflake areas and an overview of what they entail so that a member or someone who's just interested in Moms can see right then how they may get involved. If people are excited about what we do, we need to get them involved asap. I attended several Moms events in 2013 and early 2014 but it wasn't until Telisha Cobb posted a request for people to host house parties on Facebook that I got involved. I would've been involved months earlier but no one engaged me. I always wonder how many people like me are out there wanting to get more involved but not knowing how."
I live in a very supportive area. So many of the people around me are of a similar mindset. Growing our group beyond our immediate comfort zone is a challenge. And motivating people to participate!
Reorganizing and building our chapter snowflake. Getting members to take a role and commit to it. There are a small number of us handling the load. Organize area in-person meetings with training and a few statewide meetings.
I cannot come up with a way to open people's minds and really understand where we are coming from.
same as above
We are in a strongly pro-gun region. I see our leadership developing a strong organization despite this due to very fine work in following up quickly on any interest expressed and then holding meetings with interested people.
I feel the biggest challenge facing South Carolina in being effective is demographics. Because of the political majority in this state it seems to be of a challenge in other parts of the country. But with perseverance I believe we can continue to seek out more in this state who believe what we believe.
Provide training and support so members can effectively lobby state legislators.
Show of support before legislators by the entire chapter if possible
Growing our chapter in the SW part of the state (much more conservative).
"We need to find a way to harness the interest of new volunteers, and widen our team to include those who are interested."
I think generating a groundswell of active volunteers and keeping them engaged and interested.
We are separated geographically as well as we all have very busy lives. It's hard for us to get together as often as I would like.
"We are still a rather new Chapter, so are biggest challenge has been finding more Leaders and Ambassadors. Using the VAN to make welcome calls is definitely a top priority and gratefully we just recruited a Membership Lead who will be making those calls."
"I think that it is easy to get complacent in liberal MA. I think that working with other, like minded, groups would expand our numbers and help spread the word about the work Moms is doing."
"I think many of our volunteers are confused about the organization's goals and aims. For example, we wasted a LOT of time before the election rehashing the same points about what were officially approved activities. Part of that is because the organization has gone through a lot of transition during its short life. I'm hoping as time progresses, this issue will become less prevalent."
We need a chapter leader!
"We have a committed core of volunteers, but we need to reach out to more people by using VAN and having phone banks and by having one-on-ones with new people to get them to take ownership."
Minority outreach. The gun violence in our state highly affects the minority community and our chapter has struggled in reaching our and building this membership to have real impact across the state. We need to have a lead working specifically on this issue. We need to focus our membership growth in target neighborhoods and faith communities to reach out to those most affected by gun violence.
"Identifying/Engaging/activating more active volunteers. Again, we run into time constraints."
Lack of clarity about roles and lack of autonomy in planning events and publicizing them. More structure to model of roles within chapter. More structure to media and marketing materials so that chapter can more efficiently market itself and it's events.
"Political apathy. 24% of our electorate voted in the midterms, so thinking about how to motivate them to become politically engaged on this issue is daunting."
Galvanizing more volunteers
"Support--admin and press. I think this is where IL failed in general, and I wonder if it's true for elsewhere. Most of the public agree with us on issues like background checks. Speaking to people who signed our GSV pledges, they were SO happy to hear from us. But we didnt have the capacity to call every person who signed. And I wish we had done a better job of Letters to the Editors to educate the public about candidates who were stronger on our issue. In IL, and especially in Chicago suburbs, we have so many opportunities to expose those who don't support common sense gun laws, when there is such a huge need."
Increasing size of chapter Have someone in each chapter be in charge of recruitment
Our biggest challenge as a chapter is getting more of our members involved. I think we should have more FUN events &amp; encourage at-home hashtag activism.
"Outreach to rural areas. Network with simpatico orgainzations, State Democratic parties, women's groups, medical groups."
Organization
Indifference and hostility ???
Our chapter wants goals and objectives for 2015 and so we are putting that together. People are feeling a little adrift.
Finding specific tasks for new volunteers
Commitment
"Messaging. We are a very gun friendly state, but I think a lot more people would be on board if they knew more about the aims of the organization"
"We are not a cohesive group. I don't have any kind of relationshio with any other members. I think an email should be sent to members to ascertain who is serious about moving forward. Then, those who are IN should possibly schedule a monthly online or other meeting. If anything, just so we can know one another better. Maybe a survey to chapter members only so thet can tell their story and share views, or just bitch!"
"I think it's the ""approval"" bottleneck. It takes a long time to get things sent up the ladder and back down. Procedures are not always clear, we seem to be often be corrected instead knowing how to do things in advance."
Getting new members to do things. It is always just our core group.
We lack a critical mass of people to be involved in our activities. We have to continue to reach out to those who have signed up at events and try to draw them in.
"helping Californians understand that even though we have progressive laws here, there is still so much work to be done. I think I have an opportunity to advocate within the chapter to get moms to hold events."
Communication. Regular meetings and sharing of all pertinent information from national.
Turnout and apathy. Perhaps a broader variety of more active events rather than more social media campaigns would interest my volunteers.
"The biggest challenge is a lack of volunteers to fill in rolls. We have lots of interest, but it's hard to turn that into action. A very close second would the challenges with national and state relations."
Communication. More chapter meetings in person.
Keeping/engaging volunteers
"I need more leaders and active members. I want to engage them with ownership, somehow."
Membership
Stronger ties amongst members. More get-togethers may help. Momentum can be enhanced.
"I am a huge believer in mentoring. I know some companies have monthly meetings/trainings for individuals in the same job in different settings. Also, in Denver, our New ENgland region did some bonding. We could bolster our state chapters by having regional events or trainings."
I need to host events with speakers/survivors to inspire action in this community. We also need to reach out within our community.
"Our challenge is planning, focusing and getting multiple folks to do the work (instead of a small core.) I think we could address it by getting back to regular phone check ins with our leadership team. But I still don't know how to keep more than and handful of folks highly engaged."
"We are spread across a large, polarized state"
Growing membership
The legislators. Republicans. I've already discussed issues with them... they avoid eye contact now. :)
We must continue to increase membership and keep to Moms messaging that we support 2A and common sense gun laws. People still think we are anti-gun. It is also a challenge to get members to be more vocal when this is still seen as a volatile issue.
It is harder in Florida to find folks who want to stand up for gun sense. It is also difficult to figure out who might share your views before you speak.
"Again, growing the active volunteer base. And filling specific positions. I think once there are clear terms and role descriptions, this will be easier."
Getting people active in most areas seems to be a basic area of concern. Can turn people out for events but getting people to take leadership is difficult and have not been successful in doing this. Keep asking. Obviously need a better plan here.
"Bringing in ethnic diversity, young city people, rural people"
Have not had a membership lead since I took over chapter. So New member calls are desperately needed. Get VAN access for all leads to share in calls. Needed to identify &amp; activate more members. Very difficult for 7 members to run the whole state. Members want to meet on a regular basis but not enough local teams are established yet for this to happen.
We need to focus on organizing our membership and increasing the number of active participants.
"The biggest challenge is our RM. However the next biggest is something I think most states have..the regional issue. But I gather Snowflake 2 is going to send us back closer to where we started, with sub chapters or whatever by area within state. I am under the impression several of us were willing to take on Chapter Leader at least on a temporary basis, but our RM is not allowing apparently."
Creating a database for volunteers to easily pull from for events.
Talent identification and promotion. Would like to know more about best practices and successes elsewhere.
knowledge gaps
"Biggest challenge is separating the Dads from Moms and still staying ""on message"". Also, having more diverse regional/ethnic representation"
Gaining membership in certain key is parts of the state where there are likely members.
onboarding new volunteers--we need hands-on support and coaching
we need to grow to spread the work load.
We are just starting a chapter in Pueblo. We have some interested people that seem very dedicated; I just want to keep that dedication alive.
We need an identity I think if we break the chapter region down and separate upstate from Hudson valley and westchester that will help enormously
The opposition and living in Az
We're spread out so really getting to effectively communicate is difficult. I'd like to see $ set aside for state wide get togethers.
Bringing on another layer or replacements to avoid burnout
Engaging volunteers--we continue to struggle. PA is a hard state. Vols and leadership deal with a lot of burn out.
We are too spread apart and Snowflake Leads are spread too run with not enough help. I need to help find more volunteers we can count on to help consistently.
We are a big state. We prob. need two chapter leads.
"As a whole, our chapter has been torn about as Moms has changed its tune on key issues of assault weapons ban and high capacity magazine limit; Moms also changed its tune on GSV in some key ways. I am addressing it by trying to accept it and trying to find new Leads."
"Complacency. Best way to address it is to find energetic local leeds to reach out to local people (grassroots organizing) and galvanize them on specific campaigns, be they local or national. Generate group energy. Host meetings. Get people to like being activists together."
Getting active leaders who have time to and will work to develop the chapter. We also need to have more specific advocacy goals as a local chapter.
"Our regional manager. She is insecure and unsupportive. She assumes we are going behind her back, when in fact, we are just moving fast. She is reactive with important information, instead of proactive with news."
"I do not have a chapter, and I have reached out in order to help start one, to no avail. I feel this area is somewhat ignored. .. not purposely, the action has not been taken to move forward in Hampton Roads."
"We need an energetic, enthusiastic and collaborative leadership team of a variety of ages where people are encouraged to take ownership of their roles and work together towards common goals. Leadership development would be most helpful. An understanding that this movement is only sustainable if we are growing and allowing others to get involved and engaged. Our chapter members do not have the opportunity to weigh in and become invested in the movement. Our leadership team needs to be energized, fired up and encouraged to help grow the chapter together. We need an emphasis on more people oriented leadership style and not just task oriented leadership style. A focus on organizing, supporting and developing a team to encourage good teamwork and creative collaboration not just having roles defined, structures put in place and monitoring of tasks."
Not sure of this one.
"Our chapter has challenges with volunteer outreach/recruiting. We need to implement meet-ups, phone calls and low key events to draw interested members."
Reach more people to attend events
"I need a human resources director. We have so many projects and so much that could be accomplished and identifying the volunteers for those tasks is consuming.. It's not a growing membership type role - but a role of someone who I can take a job to and say -- find me the person to do 'this', and get them started....."
More info from national directly to snowflake leads. I'm not able to coach them all individually
Regular face to face meetings; maybe bi-monthly or every three to four months.
It seems that Evanston/Skokie area would be more involved but we can't get people to take on the more active roles.
The whole Alabama Gun culture that is thriving. I thinking bringing people who support Moms views together and giving them the opportunity to act and volunteer will be essential to success in our state. Creating a sense of community.
Overall we are effective and cohesive as a chapter. The challenges that come to mind are ones ALL state-wide chapters face (e.g. geographic disbursement of members) which make cohesion a challenge. Perhaps regular virtual state-wide meetings could help address this.
"Too few boots on the ground. We need to take time to build and organize membership. My approach it to try to organize teams on a county level so that multiple events can be held throughout the state and the role of Chapter Leader can in fact involve leadership. If the head of each count group could receive some training, that would be great."
I think #11 applies to our whole chapter.
Getting people outside of Chicago metro involved and active. Better recruiting and communication in these areas.
Out biggest challenge is devolving into regional groups while keeping the state focus. We need to get the right people in the ambassadorship positions.
We need more members in leadership.
Biggest challenge perhaps is getting a reliable core group of volunteers to show up when we need them. Still working on solutions.
We are a small chapter; we need to increase membership. I guess we need to be present at more public events in order to recruit members.
Recruiting and developing new members
Speaking only myself. I've studied the MN law concerning open/carry but it is difficult to truly understand it. I participated in a phone conference but each state varies significantly.
Getting together with brainstorming ideas
Not enough volunteers and people willing to be active.
"no goals for the chapter work unless a key state - have local goals, maybe build teams to address certain issues, for example the iron pipeline I95 and all chapter along that build a coalition to work on gun trafficking"
Building a larger core of volunteers is important right now. We are organizing a House Party to help search for those people. Reaching our through common existing groups has generated some success.
"No clarity for anyone on how this chapter works, what the duties of each position are and how that effects me in my position. It's unclear to almost everyone in the chapter. My answer: More transparency and clarity as to what each persons role is and how we are all to interact together. Right now we have a new communications person. None of us know what that means to each of us individually. Our newer volunteers seem lost, even some of our new Ambassadors."
gathering new members/strategies that are affective.
"We have some weakness with communicating with each other. A ""team"" style, in person training or meeting may go a long way in fostering stronger communication among each other."
Need more energetic members in my area. I don't know how to address this. All the actions I have tried have failed.
Ditto
Dont know - I am new
"Our Ambassadors have too many members in large areas. Need to be broken into smaller areas or a team approach to manage with better means of communication with others in the same role. Getting answers for snowflakes takes up a lot of my time, and much of the time, I can't get the answers in a timely manner to help them. It's also helpful to know ""why"" we are focusing or planning an activity. The Dec. 14th events were much easier to sell when I could explain WHY Moms decided to go that way instead of larger ceremonies."
"We live in Republicanville. We need to make sure we stay non partisan and find ways to ""reach out"" to everyone even gun owners. I would love to see National come up with some specific talking points."
We need more resources and training and the ability to act independently.
Very large state. Get as many members and volunteers as possible. Continue with the organizing process.
"Effective messaging and education/marketing materials around the four core Moms Demand goals for events and membership recruitment efforts. Background checks: Many Americans, my own friends included, will share that we have background checks for gun sales. They are unaware until corrected that in most states a convicted felon can purchase a gun legally. That domestic abusers or those that have a retraining order against them can still legally purchase firearms. Education around which states still allow this, how this effects all states especially regionally. For example despite strong laws in MA, RI and CT, MA is still only as ""safe"" as the lax laws in NH, VT and ME. This is the strongest argument for the need to elect congressional leaders that will close these deadly background check loopholes. Child safety: material that spells out how many children a day are effected by gun violence, most at risk age groups, and how many states have no laws in place that hold negligent adults responsible for ""accidents"" that harm or kill children. Reasonable limits on how, when, where loaded guns are carried and used in public. Which states allow open carry. Which of these states that do allow require training and/or waiting periods. Gun trafficking and fraudulent purchasing: what type of laws are currently in place nationally and by state. Having brief yet effective information in clear format to be used at membership recruitment event and efforts would be huge. As a volunteer at membership recruitment events I often feel our volunteers are not armed with up to date information and that we need to do more educating not only of our own volunteers but those we are trying to draw into our ranks."
Better organizational structure
re-organized statewide leadership. legislative strategy creation.
"We have a core of tremendously dedicated volunteers. From the small corner I saw, we do need to develop newer volunteers more; motivation, knowledge base, and communication skills."
Getting as many of our active members as possible engaged in advocacy work
Frequent turnover among snowflakes means we spend lots of time bringing new people up to speed. Sharing snowflake positions might be a way to minimize disruptions if someone leaves.
Gun culture in SC is a challenge. Would be helpful to have more info/facts/statistics to debunk some of the gun lobby's inaccuracies.
I'm still new - unsure
"More 1:1 relationship building, and time and patience :)"
"Same as above. Another big challenge is that La - and particularly its biggest cities, New Orleans and Baton Rouge, have many many problems and there are multiple ways to be involved in community work. As a result, people may feel disinclined to support a cause that many view as ""hopeless."" I'd love to see a plan developed to just get a gun safety conversation started in La to get our residents comfortable with talking about the issue without automatically assuming it's a disguised attempt to ban guns."
Often people think guns aren't an issue in a progressive state like Maryland. I think I the election of Larry Hogan may help us on that front!
"We have one active group in central Iowa and are having trouble getting members active elsewhere in the state. Offering a state-wide training/retreat might help members in those areas feel more motivated/comfortable stepping up. We have issues engaging local media. They don't take us seriously because we are too handled by the national communications team. We need to be able to handle local media with more efficient oversight. Training the regional manager or chapter leader to handle some of the smaller tasks, like LTEs, would help."
"Cohesion as a group and cooperation with allies. We a re a large, diverse state with many active gun violence groups. But we are not well-networked, and need to establish and work closely in coalition."
Not in a good position to answer this question.
Engaging volunteers; monthly meetings
Getting enough people to help. Expand our exposure to different areas of the state
"I think we need a web page that allows all communication to be put that page, including all messaging back and forth. I hesitate to put 200 emails addresses onto my computer. We need a safer way to limit our personal risk of sabotaging our home computers."
"Bandwidth: Reaching out to community organizations to help draw in volunteers. Holding events in locations meaningful to potential partners--community centers, churches, etc."
"Our biggest challenge now is transition and practically rebuilding. However, after our Chapter Lead is chosen the work can begin by defining the Leadership roles and empowering the wonderful group of volunteers we have."
We don't have many local meetings. It would be good to meet regularly to discuss plans for upcoming events.
"Because the nature of our work, particularly in GA, is inherently difficult and complicated by cultural differences (urban/rural, racial, soci-economic divides) building an effect and efficient operational network requires a lot of trust in both individual and collective efforts to avoid ""burn out"" or the group imploding on its self. More face to face time that combines work/social time would help to construct a stronger network."
We need strong leadership.
"This chapter faces a huge challenge being in a southern red state. I think grass roots, non confrontational discussions will help"
Cultural and geographic diversity. Need to carve out the groups of support downstate.
we could use more local volunteers
Just getting together and getting on the same page.
USING A ROUND ROBIN STYLE FOR MEETINGS WOULD MAKE US MORE PRODUCTIVE. VISITING TIME COULD BE AT BEGINNING/END OF MEETINGS SO THAT WE STAY ON TOPIC AND ARE EFFICIENT WITH OUR TIME.
"Our chapter is resistent to dig into VAN. Many snowflakes have such limited permissions that they can't access the welcome call list (nothing in their ""my folders"" tab). Some people have certain permissions based on their position title that they never use because they maybe fear VAN, or think its too arduous or too difficult to figure out or don't have time while other SF's who really want to use VAN don't have the permissions necessary to do what they would like to do. This could be resolved with a dedicated chapter meeting about VAN, but everyone has to have a login and the right permissions before we do that."
"More active leaders beyond the regulars who go to all/most events. Address directly what is keeping them from participating more, maybe they had a life change and offer a new role."
"Giving the tools to not only do the job, but to curb potential burnout and provide networking opportunities for Moms to meet, share, socialize, and -- very importantly -- swap best practices, etc."
"Teach grassroots organizing, providing a consistent message for members to use effectively."
Streamline training and having a system that makes it easier for volunteers to either change rolls or come into new rolls more efficiently.
Follow-up about the results of suggestions.

a sort of crash course for new chapter leaders.
"VAN, HUB, access to I want to help notices ASAP . Loose them if it takes months to get to us."
I speak Spanish. I recently learned that there is material in Spanish. Can we develop specific outreach to the HIspanic community?
"What can we tell people to do on Day 1 as a volunteer/member? We almost need to give them busy work so they feel like there is something to do. When we tell them to wait for the next event or campaign, we lose them!!"
Educating the public.
Not sure

Our number one priority at this time.
Volunteer outreach. We aren't growing much in New Mexico.
VAN
"VAN - it is a cumbersome database that intimidates most people. In addition, the processes need to be streamlined. Designated chapter leaders should be able to send emails in a more timely manner - without involving additional layers/levels of people in the process."
Allowing us to access email addresses when we pull local lists of volunteers through VAN.
"Every active state should have lots of Press Support, help with facebook posts, etc. The majority are with us, we just need to show up on their radars. And positive press will also motivate volunteers to continue."
"Put out a summary of State and Local gun laws, annotating especially the problems."

Training about gun violence specifically for domestic violence advocates
A central place to look up information or find archived training materials
"I look forward to that training. In the meantime, I'll consult with our Chapter leaders as needed."
"Yes, defining and communicating to all of us, the roles in each chapter and what they do. More than once I have felt completely alone (a horrible feeling) in carrying out the duties of my position and have had to rely on Pam Simon to help instead of other chapter members. Just having a job description is not the answer. I feel like I have seen two different job descritpions floating around for each position and just having that is not helpful. We need everyone in the chapter to have an understanding of how we all fit together and what are responsibilites are to each other."
none that are immediate
I don't think any of our needs are that urgent.
Training membership teams to move new members off the one step list into our welcomed Moms. The how to sheet is only good to get them started then the real problems start.
Not that I know of.

I attended (AND LOVED) both national events last year, but I felt a bit in the dark as to what was going on before hand. Plus, from a scheduling perspective, I think we could get a better turnout with better advanced notice. Thank you for this survey. I always feel like Moms is trying to do right by its volunteers. &lt;3"

"Email and texts and messages lend themselves to hurried abbreviated responses to questions. Often answers are not clear, vague, confusing or piecemeal and incomplete. I think it is the nature of social media. Voice to voice, face to face interactions are always more clear and effective. If we could strike a balance somehow, make sure text responses are answering g the question asked and answering completely, and occasional quick phone calls. Our area has not had interaction from regional or national other than emails or conference calls."
"Not everyone can attend everything, so a diverse set of training options would be great. I also believe in the power of people getting to know each other face to face to network and encourage one another."
I am available to make presentations on the frequency of gun violence on college campuses nationwide
"Let it be documented on paper and fully explained. Perhaps a turn-key ""kit."" E-learning is good, but people also need a quick reference sheet. And it would be nice if we could make something and then just not change it for a while."
"I don't think I am the only one who is uncomfortable with conference calls. Can't hear - prefer the eyeball to eyeball method. Videos can be effective as long as they are well done [the VAN videos are horrendous - sorry] and of there is a local leader, or someone, who can answer questions. Handouts re vital in all cases. They don't need to be 20 pages of single space text - bulleted outlines are fine."
"a big commitment of time/travel/expense is difficult for our members to make, so consider what you are asking members to commit to."
Many of us find it difficult to travel regardless of costs. Please offer national or regional training on multiple platforms.
"Again, I'd advocate for training that is in evenings/ on weekends and it would be great to include childcare for single moms or parents who have kids to juggle. I missd a training because I couldn't find/afford a babysitter."
Keep them simple. Focus on youth.
I personally commit to do the VAN training between now and January 1.
no :)
"I am unlikely to travel, even if it's paid for, or to attend a multi-day event not close to home."
"The national trainings that I attended in DC, first with MAIG, then with Moms, were extremely well organized and informative."
"face to face is always best. do them at varying levels of development, one size does not fit all. do varying types of trainings. some people are visual learners, some like to read, others learn through experiences"
"The biggest complaint from volunteers is that there are ""too many emails and they do not have time to actively participate or read the suggested links. "" More training may not help this situation."
"Once again, consistency. It does no good to have policies and procedures in place that only certain chapters are obligated to adhere to. Likewise, if a procedure is changed or eliminated, then all chapters should get the benefit of that change and not be kept in the dark. Again, knowing procedures, do/don'ts BEFORE we make major mistakes. We are volunteers and hearing the negativity gets old."
"please create, if possible) more training programs by region, state, city. keeps the juices flowing!"
No
Thank you for making this a priority.
"Regional/national trainings (ones that require travel) should be absolutely top notch or not be done. They are challenging and expensive to get to and demand some ROI. Would be great to enlist inside/outside EXPERTS on topics - not Moms Demand employees but seasoned politicos, organizers, etc."
Keep moving forward!
"We are excited to get further training, and looking forward to the process."
"I know they're obviously more expensive, but in person group ""boot camps"" seem incredibly effective, not only because they're in person but because of the team building aspect as well. Whether it's national or regional, I think these are great because you can learn from each other and the energy and camaraderie is an invaluable intangible."
"I believe to effectively build our chapter snowflake, we will need a few of our key people to travel to different areas of the state. First Philadelphia then Pittsburgh and hold membership meetings. Explaining the structure of the chapter and recruiting volunteers for the roles."
"Moms Demand Action has forged significant national alliances with other groups. I feel it would be helpful to have all members, and the general public, know about the what is happening on this."
"Whatever the training is, it would be helpful to have written hand-outs to take with us that go over what we learned about in the training session step by step."
"Its very difficult for me to travel out of state and I greatly appreciate webinars and conference calls that allow me to participate remotely. I realize the impact factor isn't the same, but long distance travel really is not an option."
Making good use of people's time for trainings is critical!
"I have always found that that people learn more with an interactive approach, rather than sitting in a large hall listening to a lecture. Plenary Sessions should be kept to 1 hour, otherwise people start to lose interest."
I'd like the designers to look at other programs that are successful (see below)
"Lots of VAN. Also, I think in-person trainings are key. The national training is great, but only possible to do once a year. Smaller statewide and regional trainings every couple months would be amazing!"
"Help us feel as close to being ""professional"" activists as is possible."
"I went to Denver to meet other volunteers. It was a wonderful experience Also, I don't know if there is a natural life cycle for a Lead or engaged volunteer. At this point, I know where my strengths are, and would like to focus on those. I've obtained so much knowledge through my journey I want to best impart that. For example, I'm considering joining the American Psychological Association's gun violence committee. And so perhaps training others on how to move forward in public service, adivsory roles, might be useful. I'm also wondering if any of our lead volunteers have given as much as they can as a volunteer, and are now looking for some compensation or recognition. I've previously mentioned that many of those in lead roles are professionals and have quite a lot to offer to the organization. I'm happy to hear that there were so many OM apps! Maybe even offering babysitting reimbursement might help!"
I don't know if many of us will have a grasp on the workings of state and local governments.
I haven't felt a part of the organization because I have never been able to attend a call since you always have them during the day and I work.
We need a training module for new volunteers.
"Reason why people have guns, how they are used, reasons behind gun rage and how this problem can be addressed or prevented in a collaborative and amiable way."
We need to be more inclusive as well in the demographics of our volunteers and leaders
"I know nothing about guns. I have been thinking about going to a reputable firearms dealer in my area to get a 101 education. Might be something to think about for a training class. I am also considering joining the NRA. Have to know the ""enemy"" before I can ""fight"" them. Please don't mistake my intentions. I just believe the more we know about what makes them tick, the better to help with a clear and non-confrontational message."
We were so motivated at the Denver training. We need to have that excitement and motivation
I'm excited about it.
Written materials that we could print for easy reference would be helpful. I keep a file of these to refresh my memory now &amp; then.
Just going back to the mentoring idea. I feel that it could be applied with many specific skill sets.
xoxoxo
Not yet. Need more information to make any kind of assessment.
"Yes, I'd love to see a snowflake assessment program. I am working on this to see what skills my leaders have, need, want support from other team members, etc. The idea is to determine where we are going in the next year. Will my snowflakes still be around? Are they interested in new roles? Are there skills they aren't using or need help with?"
I think a webinar might be the way to go. moms with kids are less likely to travel to an event. Most can connect for a couple of hours on the computer.
"For me, face to face is the strongest model. I do not feel connected when the material is only on the computer. Phone is better, face to face is best."
"Make it good. The better our skills the more effective we will be. No one wants to be part of a group whose events are poorly attended or lackluster. Our core volunteers here in Cincinnati are smart, passionate about the issue of gun violence, and really want meaningful involvement."
Be careful who you have do the training. Do they REALLY know the topic? Any experience in training?
I'm ready to go!
"For online and by-phone trainings, please consider offering live in multiple time slots. Watching a webinar after a long workday is not very appealing. i've missed out on a huge amount by not being able to participate in leadership phone calls, which would probably be more useful than specific trainings."
NA
"Regional, statewide in-person trainings would be well attended here in Wisconsin. We need good excuses to travel to get together."
I loved the last night of the Denver training. I think it's so important to laugh--even though we are dealing with life and death. Thank you for this wonderful organization!
I thought Denver was super effective and motivating. I would like to see training like that more often on a state level.
"My vols that attended the training in Denver came back VERY empowered. I wish that I could have joined. Something more manageable travel wise would be nice. I love the idea of going away for the weekend, but I am the main caregiver for my kids, so it is challenging."
"I love it when the trainings have come from other volunteers, as it is in the spirit of our grassroots organization and it doesn't feel so ""top down."" The webinar and conference call on house parties is one good example. I would love to talk to other Snowflake Leads more and feel more of a connection to other states."
"I would like to see regular regional training. Example: you could hold a 1 day New England training event in a hotel outside of Boston to serve all New England volunteers. Then we could meet our counterparts across state lines, and get training all at once."
"Our chapter liked the old way of communicating ""I want to helps"" through e-mail rather than just in a VAN phone bank."
I am happy to help in any way that I can.
I am very interested in taking part in training.
Training on leadership roles would be helpful BUT also training on how those roles work together seems beneficial. Our chapter has become very compartmentalized because we have focused on just filling the roles. We need to learn how each role can compliment and work together to get more done and work towards a common goal.
"Just to make sure the date and location is announced well ahead of time, and perhaps offer two alternate dates so that all who want to can attend."
"Once the key elements are established, we could hold ""train the trainer"" trainings and have a person in each region/chapter/state (however it works out) that is capable of training on each element as needed."
Thanks for this opportunity to grow while preventing gun violence. We need to reach other minorities communities where domestic violence is a big issue that can lead to gun deaths
"Don't think I'm crazy but I think we could all benefit from actual firearms training. I plan to pursue formal training on my own, but for those of us in the trenches to have working technical knowledge of firearms I think would help disspell the myth that we are anti-gun. I really wonder what the reaction would be if WaPo covered the story of MOMS nationwide enrolling in safety courses."
"Keep up the good work, I love the communication through Facebook and email, as well as face to face opportunities. We need more chances to go out and do something!"
I think it's really important to get us all together!
"As someone who has been with the org since close to the beginning, I didn't find much of the information in Denver to be useful. Different levels of training, depending on experience, would be a good idea."
"Since we are spread out over a state, I think role-playing videos would be excellent for new leaders to learn. I'm a retired educator - people learn best from their piers and performing the skill."
This is a fantastic organization and everyone Ive met and worked with is very dedicated!
"build a buddy system for new volunteers, team them up with someone outside their immediate chapter to learn best practices and pitfalls"
"For me, large trainings mean events that will fire up all personnel. Celebrating success, hearing dynamic speakers, motivation to keep progress in motion."
The HUB does not work real well for me. It is hard to find information I need quickly and some of the Hub is greyed out and I don't have access to it. Not sure if that is supposed to be that way or not. I always have a hard time finding what I need. I do feel it has valuable information for me but I have also found resources that I have then used and been told they were out of date.
You are all so supportive and great at giving positive feedback. Its wonderful.
I hope that it will not be one cookie-cutter program for every state. Different states have very different realities and needs. That was actually our biggest take away from Denver too. Training should not be the same in Oklahoma and Texas as it is in California and Oregon.
Go Eileen!
National does a great job with the annual training. I am so happy to be a part of this group.
"I don't want to be overly negative, but think the past few months have been very difficult for this organization. We are losing a lot of very talented and committed people. The remaining volunteers don't feel like their work is valued because of how their interactions with new national staff are going. We no longer feel very grassroots because of how everything is being managed. This needs to be addressed somehow, and I think the best way to do that is to get chapter leadership trained up so they can act more independently and then let them."
I am so impressed with all of this. The training program should have specific steps and goals to be the most effective.
That the training program design incorporates a direct flow/exchange of information. Currently troubleshooting and training feels fragmented. Those of us in the trenches need to pass our questions and challenges along to another individual (be it another individual in the chapter leadership or to a regional director) who then passes it along to the appropriate person at Moms or Everytown.
The ability to delegate.
Don't for get to make it FUN!
"Flexible formats, that I can do on my own time, are great. Participating in state/regional/national training depends on having money for travel."
It would be nice to do it on the East Coast next time. I suggest a state that has demonstrated Gun Sense--maybe Maryland? Baltimore or just outside of DC would be easy for everyone to get to.
We love hearing about what has worked in other states. Sometimes these are not nearly packaged best practices.
My personal view is that you should be very careful not to waste Moms' time. For example: -No unnecessary meetings to talk about stuff that's already covered in writing. -Don't ask me to train how to lobby if there is no plan in my State that would include lobbying activities. -Avoid fluff training activities and anything patronizing.
"Yes. Training needs to take into account and be tailored to the needs of volunteers' work and/or childcare schedules. For instance, when doing GOTV for I-594 in Washington volunteers preferred to phone bank remotely from the convenience of their homes, to meeting at a central location. What we need most is flexibility built in to any and all training and campaign efforts. Flexibility with clarity of purpose."
Not that I can think of at the moment
I think the most effective and affordable trainings are the conference calls and webinars in terms of people's availability.
I would like a MOMS power point presentation shared with me that I can present to groups in my County.
"Always room for personal stories--as we have done in the past. Survivors, history tellers, leaders and volunteers who have specific experiences in the movement that they would like to share. Humor--despite the gravity of it all--humor."
"Navigating cultural, racial, economic differences is harder for some than others. It is mission critical in GA that we diversify our membership to include rural members, black and brown members, economically disadvantaged. It may be helpful to include a training on reaching to community members who look, act or seem different or other. Since bullets don't discriminate, and we don't either, I think this component would broaden our thinking about member recruitment, how to reach out to more isolated communities most vulnerable to gun violence."
It must be comprehensive.
Colorado was fantastic. I learned so much.
PLEASE OFFER ALL MATERIALS IN PDF FORM SO THAT IT CAN BE DOWNLOADED AND ACCESSED AT ANY TIME FOR NEW MEMBERS OR FOR REFERENCE.
Our chapter needs to do some real long term planning and capacity building. Too often we get caught in current campaigns and putting out fires that we push other things aside that would really help buil our capacity in the long run. We could benefit from hitting PAUSE on these activities for a period of time so we can focus on things like making the 370 welcome calls we need to make.....calling through the list is the elephant in the room for our chapter and I personally feel like we can't effectively grow our membership until we figure out how to collectively use VAN.
