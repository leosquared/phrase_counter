Alternately, just being able to attend events when my husband is gone is difficult sometimes.

Growing our chapter through holding more events. We are so short handed, and it's always the same group of people showing up to our events. Our event lead is amazing, but she often is backed up against parameters beyond her control (budget issues, meeting space, etc.). We need the tools -- and money -- to grow this chapter, and I think that growth will start with our ability to host amazing membership meetings.","Giving the tools to not only do the job, but to curb potential burnout and provide networking opportunities for Moms to meet, share, socialize, and -- very importantly -- swap best practices, etc.",Follow-up about the results of suggestions.,"National in-person events (i.e., Indy and Denver) must be announced sooner and offer more robust information about of what is actually happening at these events.

Beth Roth,Tennessee,Ambassador,"Understanding specific objectives required to reach goals. - In my experience as a volunteer and managing volunteers, I feel that you have to be very specific about what you're trying to accomplish and how you plan to accomplish it. I feel that this true of national goals- we want to pass universal background checks, how are we going to do it? At state levels - we need to grow our membership numbers and lobby against gun bills in our state - how are we going to do it? Also - making outreach programs more ""turn key"" through the use of toolkits - which should include videos, power points/prezis, and handouts. e.g. CAP presentations, house parties, safety fairs, church groups/youth group presentations, school board presentations, etc. Having to create these yourself each time is time consuming and is often times the reason someone decides against presenting somewhere or having house party.","We must build our base of engaged, ""stakeholders."" I see Moms members in three categories - 1) general members (people who sign up and may or may not ever participate in events but who agree with us and will likely vote with us) 2) Active volunteers (people who want to get involved and attend events and who are willing to volunteer their time in small amounts to lobby, host house parties, or phone bank, etc). 3) Stakeholders/leadership (people who look at their role almost as a job, people who do something Moms-related most everyday.) Our chapter needs to do a better job converting members to volunteers and volunteers to stakeholders. I feel that we can increase these conversion rates by engaging volunteers and empowering them with information (keeping them in the loop about Moms nationally and locally), education, and responsibility. We have recently begun doing monthly mixers which I think is key to team building. We are looking to do some lobbying training as well. And, we need to do chapter or at least city-wide chapter meetings monthly or at least every other month- not just leadership meetings. Volunteers need to be trained on effective recruiting techniques. In sales, you follow the ABC - always be closing - model. We need to adopt something similar. If you're talking to someone who's interested in Moms, volunteers should be trained on how to get the person to sign up right then. When we do mixers each month, I give out an overview of each of the snowflake areas and an overview of what they entail so that a member or someone who's just interested in Moms can see right then how they may get involved. If people are excited about what we do, we need to get them involved asap. I attended several Moms events in 2013 and early 2014 but it wasn't until Telisha Cobb posted a request for people to host house parties on Facebook that I got involved. I would've been involved months earlier but no one engaged me.

But we didnt have the capacity to call every person who signed. And I wish we had done a better job of Letters to the Editors to educate the public about candidates who were stronger on our issue.

I've obtained so much knowledge through my journey I want to best impart that. For example, I'm considering joining the American Psychological Association's gun violence committee. And so perhaps training others on how to move forward in public service, adivsory roles, might be useful. I'm also wondering if any of our lead volunteers have given as much as they can as a volunteer, and are now looking for some compensation or recognition. I've previously mentioned that many of those in lead roles are professionals and have quite a lot to offer to the organization. I'm happy to hear that there were so many OM apps!

Julie Sheehan,Massachusetts,Membership Lead,At the moment my biggest volunteer role is membership lead. I often get requests to run reports of local members and/or volunteer lists for various membership recruitment events and email addresses are not included.

Solution: create guidelines/levels of access to include email addresses in these lists depending on use.,"Effective messaging and education/marketing materials around the four core Moms Demand goals for events and membership recruitment efforts. Background checks: Many Americans, my own friends included, will share that we have background checks for gun sales. They are unaware until corrected that in most states a convicted felon can purchase a gun legally. That domestic abusers or those that have a retraining order against them can still legally purchase firearms. Education around which states still allow this, how this effects all states especially regionally. For example despite strong laws in MA, RI and CT, MA is still only as ""safe"" as the lax laws in NH, VT and ME. This is the strongest argument for the need to elect congressional leaders that will close these deadly background check loopholes. Child safety: material that spells out how many children a day are effected by gun violence, most at risk age groups, and how many states have no laws in place that hold negligent adults responsible for ""accidents"" that harm or kill children. Reasonable limits on how, when, where loaded guns are carried and used in public. Which states allow open carry. Which of these states that do allow require training and/or waiting periods. Gun trafficking and fraudulent purchasing: what type of laws are currently in place nationally and by state. Having brief yet effective information in clear format to be used at membership recruitment event and efforts would be huge.

Shannon Holtzman,Louisiana,Chapter Leader,"As stated above, I do not have sufficient guidance as to what the plan is, if anything, in La.","Same as above. Another big challenge is that La - and particularly its biggest cities, New Orleans and Baton Rouge, have many many problems and there are multiple ways to be involved in community work. As a result, people may feel disinclined to support a cause that many view as ""hopeless."" I'd love to see a plan developed to just get a gun safety conversation started in La to get our residents comfortable with talking about the issue without automatically assuming it's a disguised attempt to ban guns.",Same as above. Also note that my answers above regarding the likelihood that I would attend are conditioned on cost and whether the dates and times fit within my schedule.,Same as above and VAN.,My personal view is that you should be very careful not to waste Moms' time. For example: -No unnecessary meetings to talk about stuff that's already covered in writing. -Don't ask me to train how to lobby if there is no plan in my State that would include lobbying activities. -Avoid fluff training activities and anything patronizing.,
Elizabeth Banach,Maryland,Ambassador,The biggest challenge I face is not attempting to do everything myself.

Ellyn Grimm,Iowa,Chapter Leader,"It's been hardest to recruit snowflake members and active volunteers. Moms has lost much of its original grassroots feeling, and it's becoming more difficult to keep volunteers feeling engaged and empowered. We need to provide thorough, effective trainings and then trust volunteers to carry out their work without such stringent oversight. I think some of this could be alleviated by moving some areas of oversight down to regional managers and chapter leaders.","We have one active group in central Iowa and are having trouble getting members active elsewhere in the state. Offering a state-wide training/retreat might help members in those areas feel more motivated/comfortable stepping up. We have issues engaging local media. They don't take us seriously because we are too handled by the national communications team. We need to be able to handle local media with more efficient oversight. Training the regional manager or chapter leader to handle some of the smaller tasks, like LTEs, would help.",Every volunteer is well-versed in Moms' platforms.

Denise Garcia,Washington,Ambassador,"The biggest challenge is the open-ended nature of the ambassador role: no clearly-defined job description, job ""creep"", etc. I have 25 years of project management experience in running architectural projects and I'm very frustrated by this. Ambassadorships are the ""catch-all"" role, with no set parameters, no boundaries. Perfect for burnout and high turnover. A new structure needs to be found to provide support for ambassadors; to provide them other volunteers to whom they can delegate. And no, we don't have the time to train these support positions, on top of everything else we do!",Not in a good position to answer this question.,"A clearer structure model of support for ambassadors, whether it's a ""mini-snowflake"" model or something else. Also, specialized ambassador training, a clearer job description, a maximum size for an ambassador's ""area"", as well as a ""minimum"" personnel structure to support an ambassadorship.","No, these are all long-term goals that warrant careful study.","Yes. Training needs to take into account and be tailored to the needs of volunteers' work and/or childcare schedules. For instance, when doing GOTV for I-594 in Washington volunteers preferred to phone bank remotely from the convenience of their homes, to meeting at a central location. What we need most is flexibility built in to any and all training and campaign efforts. Flexibility with clarity of purpose.",

Lindsey Donovan,Georgia,Comms,"The biggest challenge is garnering likes on our social media page ( our state chapter Facebook page). Perhaps concentrating on local stories pertaining to our state issues would address this and having our volunteers invite their Facebook friends to ""like"" our state page which would then drive traffic to the National page.","Our biggest challenge now is transition and practically rebuilding. However, after our Chapter Lead is chosen the work can begin by defining the Leadership roles and empowering the wonderful group of volunteers we have.","To provide better outreach to chapters that are in the process of gaining and losing leadership.

Kathryn Grant,Georgia,Other (pleases specify below),It would be valuable for the Chapter to have regularly planned face to face meetings to deepen relationships.,"Because the nature of our work, particularly in GA, is inherently difficult and complicated by cultural differences (urban/rural, racial, soci-economic divides) building an effect and efficient operational network requires a lot of trust in both individual and collective efforts to avoid ""burn out"" or the group imploding on its self. More face to face time that combines work/social time would help to construct a stronger network.",I would suggest including state specific goals and tailoring training to include them.,Not at this time.,"Navigating cultural, racial, economic differences is harder for some than others. It is mission critical in GA that we diversify our membership to include rural members, black and brown members, economically disadvantaged. It may be helpful to include a training on reaching to community members who look, act or seem different or other. Since bullets don't discriminate, and we don't either, I think this component would broaden our thinking about member recruitment, how to reach out to more isolated communities most vulnerable to gun violence.",

Sarah Green,North Carolina,Comms,"Biggest challenge I have is not having a clear understanding of the chain of command. Hopefully we can address this with the transition to OM's. Because processes change so rapidly (a natural part of the development of the org), sometimes volunteers are unaware of changes in procedure, sometimes I find that our RM is not clear on procedure. Maybe this info is given to the CL and doesn't filter to the rest of the chapter leadership. Better lines of communication and repeated communication about procedural changes would really help with this.","Our chapter is resistent to dig into VAN. Many snowflakes have such limited permissions that they can't access the welcome call list (nothing in their ""my folders"" tab). Some people have certain permissions based on their position title that they never use because they maybe fear VAN, or think its too arduous or too difficult to figure out or don't have time while other SF's who really want to use VAN don't have the permissions necessary to do what they would like to do. This could be resolved with a dedicated chapter meeting about VAN, but everyone has to have a login and the right permissions before we do that.","A better sense of how each chapter fits into the grand scheme/plan. Sometimes we in NC feel like we're just not a priorty for ET, our requests for action are frequently denied, we have difficulty getting small things like local memes made when we see other chapters getting them made really quickly. It may also be interesting to consider National training as not just for volunteers, but rather a training that sought to enhance volunteer/staff coordination and cooperation. I'm unaware of what kind of training staff receives, but it might be interesting to think about combined trainings that focus on building staff/volunteer relationships.",VAN- see above,Our chapter needs to do some real long term planning and capacity building. Too often we get caught in current campaigns and putting out fires that we push other things aside that would really help buil our capacity in the long run. We could benefit from hitting PAUSE on these activities for a period of time so we can focus on things like making the 370 welcome calls we need to make.....calling through the list is the elephant in the room for our chapter and I personally feel like we can't effectively grow our membership until we figure out how to collectively use VAN.,
